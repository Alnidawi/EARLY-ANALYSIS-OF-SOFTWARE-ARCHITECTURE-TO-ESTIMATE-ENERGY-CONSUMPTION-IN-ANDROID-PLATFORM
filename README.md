# EARLY ANALYSIS OF SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE TO ESTIMATE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN ANDROID PLATFORM
This work presents the energy consumption analysis of DRS. An effective application designed to be used in Android smartphones to execute primitives operations especially: retrieving data from applied database, storing and measuring the energy consumption. This application builds by two different architectures (Server and Mobile-centric) in order to identify the least energy-consuming architecture for this kind of applications.
